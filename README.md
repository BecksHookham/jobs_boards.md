Please remember to include Apprenticeships in your job search. The most comprehensive place to find them is the [Government Apprenticeship website](https://www.gov.uk/apply-apprenticeship).
If you need a reminder of eligibility criteria, we made a [video explainer](https://youtu.be/UMZ-gJYmBFw)

Right at th bottom of this page, you'll find more [search hacks](#Search-Hacks).

## Keywords to Search

In practice, you don't need to use all of these search terms to find roles. Usually frequent searches of "junior software" or "associate software" or "graduate software" will bring up all kinds of roles relevant for us.

## Search Hacks

Boost your job search success with these strategies:

- **Apply Early**  
  Early applications often increase your success rate. Limit your search to recent posts (e.g., past 24 hours or past 3 days) to catch fresh opportunities.

- **Filter for 'Employers Only'**  
  Reduce posts from recruiters by filtering for "Employers Only" where possible. Platforms like Indeed allow this, but LinkedIn does not. On direct apply sites like [Welcome to the Jungle](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en) or [Workable](https://jobs.workable.com/), you don‚Äôt need to worry about recruiter posts, as they are not allowed.

- **Avoid Recruiters Wasting Your Time**  
  Be cautious when applying to recruiters who may not add value. Here's how to identify them:
  - If the company page lists many jobs at various companies, it's likely a recruiting agency.  
  - Job specs that use phrases like "My Client" instead of naming a company are red flags.  
  - To double-check, google the company page of any job you're considering applying to.

- **Use Boolean Search Strings**  
  On platforms like LinkedIn or Google, use Boolean search terms to refine results. For example:  
  `("Junior Software Engineer" OR "Entry-Level Developer") AND ("Remote" OR "Hybrid")`

- **Leverage Alerts**  
  Set up job alerts on platforms you use frequently (LinkedIn, Indeed, Google Jobs) to get notified of new roles matching your criteria.

- **Check Company Career Pages**  
  Many roles are posted on company websites but not on job boards. Identify companies you're interested in and check their career pages directly.

- **Keep a Job Application Tracker**  
  Use a tool like [Huntr Job Tracker](https://huntr.co/product/job-tracker) to organize your job search. Track job titles, companies, dates applied, and application statuses all in one place.
